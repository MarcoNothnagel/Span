To run main you can simply type in the console: python main.py input.txt

To run test you can simply type in the console: python -m unittest test.py

The comments and documentation is quite weak but I was working on limited time (as you can see at the 2am Email for the submission)

I will try to flesh out the comments and documentations somewhere on the 9th. If time does not allow it please refer to this version
